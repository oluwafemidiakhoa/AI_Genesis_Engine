The Foundry is not a code generator; it is a commercial-grade, AI-powered SaaS that forges production-ready software boilerplates in minutes. Stop wasting weeks on tedious setup and start building what matters.
This platform solves the most painful, repetitive, and low-value part of starting any new software venture: the initial setup. Instead of manually configuring databases, authentication, and payment systems, you simply configure your desired stack, and our autonomous AI engineer builds the entire foundation for you, delivering a clean, modern, and ready-to-use codebase.
This project is the culmination of a rigorous development journey, evolving from simple scripts into a robust, autonomous agent capable of turning business requirements into functional code. It is now a monetizable product, ready for market.
‚ú® The Value Proposition: From Idea to MVP in Minutes
The Foundry is built for founders, freelancers, and developers who understand that time is the most valuable resource.
‚ö° Speed: Generate a complete boilerplate with a database, authentication, and payments in under 5 minutes, a task that typically takes days or weeks.
üß† Intelligence: Our AI doesn't just stitch together templates. It reasons about your selections to generate a cohesive, logical codebase with modern best practices.
üíé Quality: Receive clean, production-ready code using professional-grade technologies like FastAPI, PostgreSQL (with SQLAlchemy), Stripe, and Docker.
üí∞ Competitive Edge: Launch your product, startup, or SaaS business faster than your competition by skipping the most tedious phase of development.
üöÄ The Product & Business Model
The Foundry operates on a proven Freemium SaaS model, powered by Lemon Squeezy for subscription and license key management.
The Free Tier
Hosted publicly, the free tier acts as our primary marketing and user acquisition engine.
What it does: Allows any user to generate a basic Flask or FastAPI + SQLite application.
Purpose: Demonstrates the core magic of the AI instantly. Builds trust and showcases the quality of the generated code. Every free download contains a README.md that encourages upgrading to Pro.
The Pro Tier
This is the core, monetizable product. Users purchase a license key from our marketing website to unlock the high-value features.
Price: $29/month (or a similar one-time fee).
Unlocked Features:
PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM integration.
Full User Authentication (registration, login/logout, JWT/sessions).
Stripe Subscription Payments boilerplate.
Production-ready Dockerfile generation.
(Future) React/Next.js frontend scaffolding.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
The Foundry is a testament to a modern, robust AI-powered architecture.
UI Framework: Gradio (hosted on Hugging Face Spaces).
Core AI Engine: OpenAI GPT-4o (chosen for its superior reasoning and tool-calling capabilities).
Payment & Licensing: Lemon Squeezy API.
Execution Environment: Python subprocess for sandboxed command execution.
Core Logic: The "Singularity" agent model‚Äîa single, powerful AI mind given a clear objective and a set of atomic tools, which has proven more robust and reliable than complex multi-agent systems.
üìà Go-to-Market & Action Plan
This is a real business plan, ready to execute.
Finalize the Product (Current State): The application is built and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, with the Freemium/Pro gate implemented.
Set Up the "Storefront":
A subscription product is configured on Lemon Squeezy.
A simple, compelling landing page is built using Carrd.co or Webflow.
.
The public Hugging Face Space is embedded directly into the landing page as the "Free Demo."
A prominent "Go Pro" button links directly to the Lemon Squeezy checkout page.
Launch:
Execute a coordinated launch on Product Hunt, Hacker News (Show HN), and relevant subreddits like /r/sideproject.
Engage with the community, answer questions, and gather feedback.
Iterate:
Use customer feedback to add more high-value boilerplate options (e.g., different frontend frameworks, other payment providers, different database types).
Continuously refine the "Prompt Engineer" to improve the quality of the generated code.
üöÄ Getting Started (For Development)
Follow these steps to run The Foundry on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or higher
An OpenAI API Key
A Lemon Squeezy API Key (for the payment gate)
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/mgmbam/AI_Genesis_Engine
cd AI_Genesis_Engine
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install Dependencies:
Generated bash
pip install gradio openai requests
Use code with caution.
Bash
Set Environment Secrets:
Create a .env file in the root directory or set environment variables directly. You will need:
Generated code
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY="..."
Use code with caution.
If deploying to Hugging Face Spaces, set these as Repository secrets in the Space settings.
How to Run
Execute the main script:
Generated bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Open the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:7860.
Test the Freemium & Pro Gate:
Click "Activate System Engine".
Try generating a boilerplate with the default (free) options.
Enter a valid Lemon Squeezy license key to unlock the Pro features and test a more advanced boilerplate generation.
